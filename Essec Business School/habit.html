					Giant pandas spend most of the rest of their time sleeping, except for half of their time to eat every day. In the wild, giant pandas sleep for 2-4 hours between every two meals, lying flat, side-lying, prone, stretching or curling up are their preferred sleeping methods. In the zoo, keepers feed them regularly twice a day, so pandas spend the rest of their time resting. Giant pandas look cute even when they are sleeping. They are very flexible and can put their heavy bodies in various positions. My favorite position is to put my legs on a tree and cover my eyes with my hands.
					<br />
					The most lovely feature of giant pandas is their chubby body and their slow walking style. This is because they live in an environment where there is enough food, no natural enemies and no need to act quickly. But it is this slow motion that enables it to conserve energy to adapt to low-energy foods. They sometimes climb trees to spy on situations, escape intruders, or take a nap.
					<br />
					Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and playing. Tree climbing is generally a way of avoiding the strong by approaching the marriage proposal, or avoiding danger, or meeting the weak when they meet each other. Pandas sometimes go down to valleys, into villages or houses, use pots and barrels, especially round utensils, as toys, and abandon the mountains after playing. Sometimes they are friendly with their domestic animals, such as sheep, pigs, and so on.
					<br />
					Usually, giant pandas are very gentle in temperament. When they meet for the first time, they often mask their forepalms or lower their heads without revealing their true features. They seldom attack other animals or people on their own initiative. When they meet by chance in the wild, they always avoid it. But when a mother becomes a mother, her baby is sacred and inviolable, even if it is concerned about visiting, it will make her angry, open her teeth, dance her claws and start her feet. Sometimes they also like to make some decorations and other adaptation activities. You can stretch your body like a cat, stretch out in front, lift the back half of your body, and let your body stretch flexibly, or yawn straight in front of your legs when you wake up. If the water is wet or wading across the river, you can shake it off like a dog.
					<br />
					In the wild, giant pandas often clashed in estrus season, especially when three to four male pursuing an oestrous female. Sometimes, there are fights between males and females. In zoos, they usually fight because water, food or a giant panda occupies good territory.
